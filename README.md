# Quarkus OpenTelemetry Exporters

## About Exporters

Exporters are OpenTelemetry SDK Plugins which implement the Exporter interface, and emit telemetry to consumers, usually observability vendors.
Currently, we support this implementation:
* Jaeger
* Microsoft Azure
* Google Cloud Platform (Not available in native mode)

This extension's version is aligned with the latest Quarkus version at the moment of each release, since v3.5.0.
